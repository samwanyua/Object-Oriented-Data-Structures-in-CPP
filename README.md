# Object-Oriented-Data-Structures-in-CPP

Welcome to the C++ Programming course! This repo is designed to equip one with , establishing a solid foundation for implementing data structures as C++ classes.

## Course Overview

DSA & Algorithms
1. Data structures
2. Algorithms
3. Big O notation, Omega, Theta
4. Linear Data structures - stacks, queues, Linked lists(Singly, Doubly,Circular)
5. Non-linear data structures - trees, binary trees, AVL tree, M way trees, B tree, B* tree, graphs
6. Sorting and searching algorithms - bubble sort, insertion sort, radix sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell sort, linear search, binary search
7. Hashing 


## How to Get Started

To begin your C++ journey, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [repository_url]`
2. **Practice Coding:** Implement the concepts learned by working on coding exercises and projects.


Happy Coding! ðŸš€
